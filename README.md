LOCARS (short for Life Organisation Computer Access and Retrieval System) is inspired by [LCARS](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/de/wiki/LCARS). In the Star Trek Universe, more specifically in the shows playing in the 24th century, LCARS is the standard OS on seemingly every Federation console.

## Design Philosophy

The System will eventually be available on the Web, as a Desktop App and on mobile devices. However, I do not believe the UI should be indentical. As much as I admire seeing other people's attempts at making an LCARS UI, they are a little too unorganized for my taste. Sure, I'd love to waste time clicking buttons just to feel like I'm living in a better future. But the goal here is not to copy LCARS (on that note: please don't sue me) but rather the idea. The LCARS UI made flying starships look simple or at least straightforward. But we're not building a spaceship and LCARS was never designed to be used with a keyboard and mouse. The goal here is to make one "Operating" System (I'll get there one day) for all devices and all needs without distractions or ads. On mobile devices and touchscreens having more buttons to press will be nice, on PC the challenge is greater.

## BUT

For now I'm doing this solely for myself. I'm not trying to write bad code or only make decisions based on what I currently need, but I'm still an intermediate programmer with little experience and I'm alone.
However, I hope this will eventually become a Community Project.

### ...

Yes, I will eventually clean up this Read-Me too but right now I gotta go and it's not like anyone's gonna read this anytime soon...
